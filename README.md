# ArtemisFinancialSNHU

Client Overview

Client: Artemis Financial, a company offering financial services such as wealth management, investment advice, and financial planning.

Issue: Address security vulnerabilities in their software to protect sensitive financial data and ensure secure communications.
Addressing Software Security Vulnerabilities

What was done well:

    Thoroughly reviewed the codebase for potential weak points.
    Utilized security testing tools and best practices for secure coding.
    Documented each vulnerability, its impact, and proposed solutions.

Importance of secure coding:

    Prevents unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.
    Maintains the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data.

Value of software security:

    Protects sensitive information, ensures regulatory compliance, maintains customer trust, and prevents financial losses.

Vulnerability Assessment

Challenges: Identifying hidden vulnerabilities that were not immediately apparent during the initial code review.

Helpful tools: OWASP Dependency-Check and manual code reviews.
Increasing Layers of Security

Methods used:

    Implemented AES encryption with a 256-bit key for data at rest and in transit.
    Generated a self-signed certificate for HTTPS communication.
    Implemented cryptographic hash functions to verify data integrity.

Future assessment techniques:

    Use a combination of automated security testing tools and manual code reviews.
    Follow established security best practices and regularly update dependencies.

Ensuring Functional and Secure Code

Steps taken:

    Performed functional testing after refactoring.
    Conducted secondary static testing using OWASP Dependency-Check.
    Manually reviewed code to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

Resources, Tools, and Coding Practices

Helpful tools and practices:

    OWASP Dependency-Check: For identifying known vulnerabilities.
    Java Keytool: For generating self-signed certificates and managing keystores.
    Spring Boot: For implementing secure HTTPS communication.
    SHA-256 Hash Algorithm: For ensuring data integrity.
    AES Algorithm: For encrypting sensitive data.
    Manual Code Review: For identifying potential vulnerabilities.

Examples of Work

For future employers:

    Refactored code snippets demonstrating secure coding practices.
    Screenshots of successful application execution with HTTPS enabled.
    Dependency-check reports illustrating security status before and after refactoring.
    Documentation of the security assessment process and mitigation techniques.

Summary

We examined and refactored Artemis Financialâ€™s software to address security vulnerabilities and ensure secure communication. Key steps included implementing AES encryption, generating a self-signed certificate for HTTPS, adding an endpoint for SHA-256 checksum, and updating application properties for HTTPS. Secondary static testing using OWASP Dependency-Check confirmed compliance with security enhancements. The final report includes documentation, code snippets, and screenshots demonstrating the successful execution and security improvements.
